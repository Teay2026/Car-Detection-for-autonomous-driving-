# Autonomous Driving - Car Detection

This project is part of my certificate course in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It serves as a hands-on assignment to reinforce the understanding of object detection and the application of YOLO in the context of autonomous driving.

The assignment contained blank functions that I implemented myself, demonstrating an understanding of the global project, the functioning of the YOLO algorithm, and other useful concepts such as non-max suppression.

In this notebook, we'll implement object detection using the powerful YOLO (You Only Look Once) model. The concepts presented in this notebook are based on the works of Redmon et al., 2016, and Redmon and Farhadi, 2016.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project were to:

- Detect objects in a car detection dataset
- Implement non-max suppression to increase accuracy
- Implement intersection over union
- Handle bounding boxes, a type of image annotation popular in deep learning

## Results

Here are some screenshots of the results:
